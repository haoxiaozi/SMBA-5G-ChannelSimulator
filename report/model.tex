\chapter{Model}\label{chap:model}

Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (HyperNEAT) is an indirect encoding for evolving artificial neuronal networks (ANNs).

The HyperNEAT algorithm, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:hyperneat}, consists of three major components:
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item A Compositional Pattern Producing Network (CPPN) that acts as a genome.
    \item A genetic NEAT algorithm that evolves the CPPN.
    \item An artificial neural network (ANN) that acts as a phenotype.
\end{enumerate}
