\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}\label{chap:conclusion_outlook}

The channel model given in this report can be further expanded by including signal attenuation
due to multipath. However, the mathematical model becomes non-trivial and the usage of existing
implementations may be wise, such as Matlab's Phased Array System Toolbox. Multipath effects 
produce curious results in respect to transmiter and receiver heights, where signals can be attenuated
or amplified \cite{matlab-rf}. \\
Furthermore, a MIMO channel model with corresponding channel matrix may be of utter interest, given 
MIMO usage in LTE and especially 5G networks. With MIMO, it would be interesting to compare the effects 
of signal attenuation between different operating modes i.e. precoding (for maximum single channel signal strength)
verses spatial multiplexing (for parallel channels on the same carrier frequency) \cite{tse2005fundamentals}. \\
Overall, the channel model and it's python implementation give a basic toolbox to generate
channel capacity plots for various environments and influencing factors. Basic esimates about 
necessary base station density for given data rates in given environments can be made.
